Q) Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

Data Types:
A data type defines the type of data that a variable can hold in a programming language. Data types ensure that data is handled correctly and efficiently.

Data types are broadly classified into 2 types
1.Primitive Data Types:
  STRING 
  NUMBER
  BOOL
  NULL
  UNDEFINED
  1.string:- sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes / single quotes / backticks(``).
    let message = "Hello, World!";  

  2.number :- it stores all the number data types such as integer , float values etc.
    let count = 42;  
    let pi = 3.14159;  

  3.boolean :- it stores true/false values.
    let isAvailable = true;  
    let isLoggedIn = false;  

  4.undefined :- it refers to any variable declared but not initialized.
    let emptyValue = null;  

  5.null :- empty of object.
    let uninitialized;  // Undefined  



2. NON permeative data types:
  non permeative can store multiple values
  they are user defined
  FUNCTIONS
  ARRAYS
  OBJECTS
  1.Functions: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task, takes inputs (optional), processes them, and may return a value.
    function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }

  2.Arrays: A collection of elements (values or objects) stored in a single variable, typically of the same data type, indexed numerically starting from 0.
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  3.Objects: A collection of key-value pairs used to store data and methods, where keys are property names and values can be data or functions.
    let person = {
    name: "Pravallika",
    age: 25,
    greet: function() { return "Hi!"; }
    };
